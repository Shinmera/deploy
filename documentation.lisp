The args list's arguments are automatically turned into

- SYSTEM  The ASDF system object the application is built
          with.
- OP      The ASDF operation object used to build the
          application.

The following hook types are recognised:
- :deploy  These functions are responsible for copying
           files into the deployment target directory.
           It supplies the following extra arguments:
  - DIRECTORY  The target directory into which resource
               files should be placed.

- :build   These functions should prepare the system for
           the dump to binary. Specifically you might
           want to shut down existing threads, close file
           handles, remove unneeded baggage, and remove
           potentially sensitive information about your
           system.

- :boot    These functions are run right before the
           primary entry point is executed. Thus they are
           responsible for preparing the runtime to
           continue by restarting threads, re-opening
           files, and so forth.
           It supplies the following extra arguments:
  - DIRECTORY  The directory in which the resource files
               now reside after boot.

- :quit    These functions are run right before the
           executable exits completely. They offer a
           last-minute opportunity to dump some
           information about the system, or to clean up
           vital resources.
